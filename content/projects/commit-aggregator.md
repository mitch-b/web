It recently occurred to me that GitHub, as a closed source product, is home to a lot of the world's open source code. While that isn't necessarily a *bad* thing, it seems that if you aren't committing on GitHub, your open source contributions aren't being noticed. Now, that is a bad thing.

Wouldn't it be great if you could get an accurate picture of all your commits across major providers like GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab, and others, all in one place? This was the inspiration for the Commit Aggregator project.

The goal was to have an embeddable plugin any developer can add to his/her own site, providing their own worklog for everyone to see - whether or not they are followed on GitHub/BitBucket/GitLab/etc or not. This way, if something catches their eye, they can immediately follow a link to the project.
