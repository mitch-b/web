Summary: An interactive IRC bot for abraxas.pw

* [Source Code](https://bitbucket.com/mitch-b/casul-ircbot-python){:target="_blank"}

This project was a direct result of my desire to learn the Python language. My friend was running an IRC server, and had a desire for a bot to perform some basic tasks for the users.

It is built with a highly modular design to allow other developers to easily drop in a new Python module and have their code working right away. If this is interesting to you, please take a look at my implementation. I'm sure there are better ways (like I said, this was my first attempt!), but this seems to be working for now!

The bot performs some basic functionality:

* Uptime counter
* SQLite User Points
* Reconnect
* Hacker News article posting
* Integrated help command

For these features and more, check out the bot source!
