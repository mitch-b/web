Immediately after watching [John Oliver's rant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpbOEoRrHyU) on the FCC's request for public comments on Net Neutrality, I knew it would be incredibly interesting to see what people were saying.

At the time, I was trying to learn the Python language (hissssss), so I took the opportunity to build a comment scraper, and tag cloud generator based on the most common words used in a city's comments.

I always had intentions on building a national level cloud, and publishing that data - but I never got to that point. Unfortunately, someone else on the internet beat me to the punch (over a month later!), so the data is available if you search for it.
