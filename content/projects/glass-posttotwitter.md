Summary: Sample Glass GDK app to Post to Twitter during Hack Omaha (demo app)

* [Source Code](https://github.com/mitch-b/glass-posttotwitter){:target="_blank"}

Before Hack Omaha in November 2013, I had been struggling to find a great demo application for Google Glass, which I had received several months prior. At a minimum, I could try using the Glass GDK to build a quick Twitter posting utility to post to my account based on voice dictation. Anything I spoke, would be appended with [#hackomaha](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23hackomaha){:target="_blank"}. Typical usage would work like:

*"OK Glass, post to twitter ... made my first commit!"*

Then, a second or two later, my twitter feed would display:

*made my first commit! #hackomaha*
