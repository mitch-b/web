Summary: The new home for me on the Internet
Comments: off

It's been a long time, Internet.

If I had to guess, the last time I actually had content on mitchbarry.com was probably back in 2011. Since then, it's been plagued by a nasty 'Coming Soon' message (which -- you guessed it -- didn't mean anything), and even 404's!

Somewhat recently I've had the desire to finally get a single place to make all the work I've been doing public, and to let people know about it. Please check out the [Projects](/category/projects.html) page to find what I'm working on!
