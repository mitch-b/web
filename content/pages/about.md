Summary: About

I am a software developer who enjoys writing code - imagine that.

The goal of this site is to create a central location for all of the public projects I am working on, and to generate some sort of online presence that isn't commit messages.

I enjoy dabbling in a variety of languages and projects with the goal of making sure I *never get anything finished*. Okay, maybe that isn't the goal, but it certainly is a side-effect. More recently, my interests have turned to home automation, and mobile application development.
