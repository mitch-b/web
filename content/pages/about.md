Summary: About

I am a software developer who enjoys writing code - imagine that.

The goal of this site is to create a central location for all of the public projects I am working on, and to generate some sort of online presence that isn't commit messages.

I enjoy dabbling in a variety of languages and projects with the goal of always learning something new. More recently, my interests have turned to home automation, and mobile application development.
